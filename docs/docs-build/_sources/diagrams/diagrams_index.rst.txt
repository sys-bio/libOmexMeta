Building Diagrams
=================

Diagrams of the RDF graph can be produced because the Redland libraries
support serializing to `dot` format, the format used by graphviz. Therefore
using Python, it is trivial to serialize to dot and then draw the diagram
using graphviz. Here is an example where we download the `Teusink2000` glycolysis
model, use an sqlite3 database as a triple store and produce a graph
of the Teusink annotations.
